## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
   Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
       ],
   ```
1. And,
   change it to the following, i.e.,
   put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
   ```
   * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
     you will not install this forked version of the package,
     but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,

## How to use
Switch to a file with a list you want to modify and select an operation to perform from the Command Palette
(or using `Edit -> Lines - Multisets` menu).
## Operations
### Add
The result is all items from both lists. Example:

List 1 | List 2
-------|-------
one | two
three | three
four | four
four |

Result: one, two, three, three, four, four, four

### [Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Unions)
The result is items from both lists, but only one item for every match. Example:

List 1 | List 2 | Match
-------|--------|------
one | two |
three | three | :heavy_check_mark:
four | four | :heavy_check_mark:
four |  |

Result: one, two, three, four, four

### [Intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Intersections)
The result is only items that exist in both lists. Example:

List 1 | List 2 | Match | Result
-------|--------|-------|-------
one | two | |
three | three | :heavy_check_mark: | three
four | four | :heavy_check_mark: | four
four | five | |
five | five | :heavy_check_mark: | five
five | five | :heavy_check_mark: | five

### [Difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory))
The result is items from list 1 that don't have a match in list 2. Example:

List 1 | List 2 | Match | Result

one | two | | one
three | three | :heavy_check_mark: |
four | four | :heavy_check_mark: |
four | five | | four
five | five | :heavy_check_mark: |
five | five | :heavy_check_mark: |

### [Symmetric difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference)

one | two |
three | three | :heavy_check_mark:
four | four | :heavy_check_mark:
four | five |
five | five | :heavy_check_mark:
